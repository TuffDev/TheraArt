# What is TheraArt?

#### October 24th, 2020 by [Adam, Uwem, Joseph](/)

## Inspiration🔥
2020 has felt like the final boss of an impossible video game. We are still dealing with Covid-19, climate change, unemployment, and the list goes on and on. And as the winter season approaches us, Covid-19 cases will continue to grow. We believe that the mental well-being of of everyone should be a priority, regardless of where they live. After doing some research, we discovered art therapy and found and found out that it was a creative and helpful outlet to improve people's mental health.

## What it does💁‍♀️
TheraArt determines the current location of the user and shows them a map of all the different art therapists in their general vicinity. 

## How I built it👷‍♂️
We used Google Cloud Platform-Datastore to store our data, and we used Flask to create our REST API. For the frontend, we used React, along with Google maps to display the map of therapists. We also used Google Cloud Platform-AppEngine to deploy our site.

## Challenges I ran into🤔
Time.  We would've liked to have been able to implement more CRUD support for our data.
We were not able to implement the feature to allow users to filter their therapists by the specific type of art therapy (i.e finger painting, sketching, music, etc...)  
   

## Accomplishments that I'm proud of🥇
We were able to successfully deploy a React-Flask app to Google-AppEngine.

## What I learned👨‍🏫
In terms of technical knowledge, we learned a lot about Google's SDK. Overall, I think the most valuable lesson was that you can build something fun that also has the potential to help people out.

## What's next for TheraArt🤷‍♂️
We want to implement a feature where the user can filter the therapists by the type of Art Therapy that a specific therapist practices. Another awesome feature would be to add zoom support so that clients can get virtual therapy over zoom, rather than meeting the therapist in person
